# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For this example, we will add Databricks ebook PDFs from [Databricks resources page](https://www.databricks.com/resources) to our knowledge database.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Note: This demo is advanced content, we strongly recommend going over the simple version first to learn the basics. You can find the introductory version [here](https://notebooks.databricks.com/demos/llm-rag-chatbot/index.html#).**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Here are all the detailed steps:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Use autoloader to load the binary PDFs into our first table. 
# MAGIC - Use the `unstructured` library  to parse the text content of the PDFs.
# MAGIC - Use `llama_index` or `Langchain` to split the texts into chuncks.
# MAGIC - Compute embeddings for the chunks.
# MAGIC - Save our text chunks + embeddings in a Delta Lake table, ready for Vector Search indexing.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Lakehouse AI not only provides state of the art solutions to accelerate your AI and LLM projects, but also to accelerate data ingestion and preparation at scale, including unstructured data like PDFs.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC The Data Preparation for PDFs usually includes the steps below, and we are going to follow a similar flow.
# MAGIC <br>
# MAGIC </br>
# MAGIC * Ingest the PDFs as a Delta Lake table with the provided path urls. We'll use [Databricks Autoloader](https://docs.databricks.com/en/ingestion/auto-loader/index.html) to incrementally ingest new files, autoloader easily ingests our unstructured PDF data in binary format.
# MAGIC * OCR the images to text [***Note**: Your cluster will need a few extra libraries that you would typically install with a cluster init script.*]
# MAGIC * Extract text for each PDF file
# MAGIC * Use libraries to clean the text. This would include removing headers, footers, or any information that you do not want to consider.
# MAGIC * UDF functions can be used to scale the ingestion process. Using those, you can execute the ingestion + transformation in parallel instead of doing everything serially.
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Use Volumes to store non-tabular data and govern Access 
spark.sql("CREATE VOLUME IF NOT EXISTS volume_databricks_documentation")
# List our raw PDF docs
volume_folder =  f"/Volumes/{catalog}/{dbName}/volume_databricks_documentation"
# Let's upload some pdf files to our volume as example
upload_pdfs_to_volume(volume_folder+"/databricks-pdf")

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,List of pdf files
display(dbutils.fs.ls(volume_folder+"/databricks-pdf"))

# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Chunking?
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Why?** 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC LLM models typically have a maximum input context length, and you won't be able to compute embeddings for very long texts.
# MAGIC In addition, the longer your context length is, the longer it will take for the model to provide a response.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For determining the chunking strategy, start with:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC *  How relevant is the context to the prompt?
# MAGIC * How much context/chunks can I fit within the modelâ€™s token limit?
# MAGIC * User behavior? Are they going to ask long queries?
# MAGIC * Do I need to pass this output to the next LLM? 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **How?**
# MAGIC * 1:1
# MAGIC * 1:N
# MAGIC * many more
# MAGIC     - Sentence Segmentation: Breaking long paragraphs or documents into individual sentences.
# MAGIC     - Paragraph Segmentation: Breaking longer texts into smaller paragraphs or sections.
# MAGIC     - Tokenization: Breaking text into individual tokens or words.
# MAGIC     - Topic Modeling: Identifying key topics or themes within a large text and segmenting based on these themes.
# MAGIC     - Attention Mechanisms: Focusing attention on relevant parts of the input text while processing.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC *Document preparation is key for your model to perform well, and multiple strategies exist depending on your dataset:*
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Split document into small chunks (paragraph, h2...)
# MAGIC - Truncate documents to a fixed length
# MAGIC - The chunk size depends on your content and how you'll be using it to craft your prompt. Adding multiple small doc chunks in your prompt might give different results than sending only a big one
# MAGIC - Split into big chunks and ask a model to summarize each chunk as a one-off job, for faster live inference
# MAGIC - Create multiple agents to evaluate each bigger document in parallel, and ask a final agent to craft your answer...

# MAGIC <img src="https://github.com/databricks-demos/dbdemos-resources/blob/main/images/product/chatbot-rag/chunk-window-size.png?raw=true" style="float: right" width="700px">
# MAGIC <br/>
# MAGIC The PDFs can be very large, this is too long to be sent as the prompt to our model. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Even for this workshop, some PDFs are very large, with a lot of text. Some recent studies also suggest that bigger window size isn't always better, as the LLMs seem to focus on the beginning and end of your prompt.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We'll extract the content and then use llama_index `SentenceSplitter`, and ensure that each chunk isn't bigger than 500 tokens. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **The chunk size and chunk overlap depend on the use case and the PDF files.**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC *Remember that your prompt+answer should stay below your model max window size (4096 for llama2).*
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### LLM Window size and Tokenizer
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The same sentence might return different tokens for different models. LLMs are shipped with a `Tokenizer` that you can use to count tokens for a given sentence (usually more than the number of words) (see [Hugging Face documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/tokenizer_summary) or [OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken))
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Make sure the tokenizer you'll be using here matches your model. We'll be using the `transformers` library to count llama2 tokens with its tokenizer. This will also keep our document token size below our embedding max size (1024).

# MAGIC
# MAGIC Databricks provide multiple types of vector search indexes:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - **Managed embeddings**: you provide a text column and endpoint name and Databricks synchronizes the index with your Delta table 
# MAGIC - **Self Managed embeddings**: you compute the embeddings and save them as a field of your Delta Table, Databricks will then synchronize the index
# MAGIC - **Direct index**: when you want to use and update the index without having a Delta Table. The user is responsible for updating this table using the REST API or the Python SDK. This type of index cannot be created using the UI. You must use the REST API or the SDK.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this workshop, we will show you how to setup a **Self-managed Embeddings** index.
